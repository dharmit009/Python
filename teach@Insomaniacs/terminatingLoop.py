# What are Terminating Loops?
#
# The Loops which get terminated after meeting there conditions are
# known as **Terminating Loops**.

# Here is an example of the same:

n=0
while n<6:
    print("The value of n: ", n);
    n+=1;

# First we declare a variable known as `n` and initailize it with a
# value of 6. To show a an example of terminating loop we are using
# while loop here. In while loop we set condition as if n less than 6
# then run this block of statements. Now when the value of `n` is less
# than 6 it runs the particular block of code. The following block of
# code simply prints the value of n and increments it by 1. This repeats
# until the condition is met. Once the condition is met python exits the
# loop and continues to execute further statements if any.
