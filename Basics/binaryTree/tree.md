# Tree: 

A tree is a hierarchical data structure which has nodes attached
to its root value. 

## What is a binary tree?

A Binary tree is data structure in which each nodes has at most
two children nodes, which are reffered as the left child and the
right child nodes. 

### Traversal Of Binary Tree: 

There are three types of traversal can be applied on binary tree
and they are as follows:

* Pre-order Traversal.
* In-order Traversal.
* Post-order Traversal.

**1. Pre-order Traversal:**

I like to call pre-order traversal as the outer boundary of
the tree as if you travel from outerside of the tree you 
will get the traversal.
