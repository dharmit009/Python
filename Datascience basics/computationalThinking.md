# Declarative knowledge: 

This know primarily consist of factual information. 

## Imperative knowledge: 

Imperative knowledge is a `recipe` or a `how to guide`.

*Example:*

Square root of x is y such that `y*y=x`. 

Now this is decalarative knowledge i.e it is a factual information. 

Now the Imperative approach to the same will be: 

- Start with a guess g. 
- If g\*g is close enough to x, then stop and say g is the answer. 
- else take a new guess, by averaging g and x/g. 
- Using the new guess, repeat the process until close enough. 

## What is recipe? 

- Sequence of simple steps. 
- Flow of control process that specifies when each step is executed. 
- A means to detemine when to stop.

## Types of Computer: 

There are two types of computer mainly: 

1. Fixed program: computers desinged only run fixed programs. 
1. Stored program: computers designed to store and execute instructions.

### Basic Computer Architecture:

1. Input. 
1. Memory. 
1. Control Unit.
1. Arithmetic Logic Unit. 
1. Output.
