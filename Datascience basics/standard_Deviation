[1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10] 

1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10 / 10 = 5.5 = avg

difference betn each term and avg 
square the difference and calculate the avg again, 

1 - 5.5 = (-4.5)^2 
2 - 5.5 = (-3.5)^2

(-4.5)^2 + (-3.5)^2 + .... / 10 = avgDifference i.e Variance

Take sqrt(avgDifference)

std_deviation = sqrt(avgDifference);
